#  Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases data analysis projects using Notebook, focused on real-world societal issues: **road accidents** and **student depression**. Each notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and visualization to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

##  1. Road Accidents Analysis

 **File**: `road_accidents.ipynb`
 
 **Objective**: Analyze factors influencing traffic accidents such as weather, time, and location.
 
 **Highlights**:
  - Time-series analysis of accident frequency
  - Severity heatmaps by region and hour
  - Identification of peak accident periods
 **Libraries**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

##  2. Student Depression Analysis & Prediction

 **File**: `student_depression.ipynb`
 
 **Objective**: Analyze student mental health data to understand and predict depression risk.
 
 **Highlights**:
  -  **EDA** on academic pressure, sleep duration, CGPA, ...
  -  **Machine Learning** models for depression prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  -  **Performance Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision-recall
  -  **Association Rule Mining** using Apriori to uncover hidden patterns and co-occurring factors
 **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
